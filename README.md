* When a user first lands on the landing page, he/she encounters a beautiful user front page interface that has a navbar at the top which has a home, all-blogs and sign-in links. The sign in link leads to the login page, which, if the user does
not have an account, is required to create one by following the red 'register' link.
* When a user registers with the app, he/she receives an email welcoming him/her to the application using the email they
provided at the registration stage.
* Once a user has registered, the user is led back to the home page from where he/she can navigate to the sign in page to login. Once logged in, the user can enjoy such privileges as creating blogs by following the link that will now be available at the navbar or commenting, upvoting or downvoting any of the already available blogs on the landing page.
